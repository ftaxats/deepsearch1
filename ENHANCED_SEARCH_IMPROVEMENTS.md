## üéØ Enhanced Crawling Strategies

### Intelligence Type Targeting

1. **Pricing Intelligence**
   - **Discovery**: Search queries for pricing, plans, cost, subscription, enterprise terms
   - **Extracts**: Pricing tiers, enterprise options, free trials, payment methods

2. **Team Intelligence**
   - **Discovery**: Search queries for team, leadership, founders, executives, about content
   - **Extracts**: Leadership bios, team structure, key personnel, company size

3. **Customer Intelligence**
   - **Discovery**: Search queries for customers, case studies, testimonials, success stories
   - **Extracts**: Customer names, case studies, testimonials, served industries

4. **Product Intelligence**
   - **Discovery**: Search queries for products, features, solutions, platform, services
   - **Extracts**: Product descriptions, features, integrations, use cases

5. **Competitive Intelligence**
   - **Discovery**: Search queries for compare, vs, alternatives, competition terms
   - **Extracts**: Competitor names, comparisons, competitive advantages

### Advanced Crawling Features

- **Search-First Discovery** - Uses targeted search queries to find relevant pages instead of hardcoded paths
- **Dynamic URL Discovery** - Adapts to each website's unique URL structure and content organization
- **Relevance Scoring** - Automatically ranks discovered pages by relevance to intelligence type
- **Content Quality Filtering** - Excludes low-value content (blogs, support, legal) automatically
- **Parallel Processing** - Processes multiple intelligence types simultaneously
- **Duplicate Detection** - Removes duplicate content across crawled pages

## üìà Performance & Efficiency Improvements

### Crawling Efficiency
- **Search-Based Discovery** - Finds relevant pages through intelligent search queries instead of hardcoded assumptions
- **Adaptive URL Discovery** - Works with any website structure, regardless of URL patterns
- **Smart Content Filtering** - Automatically excludes low-value content based on URL patterns and content analysis
- **Parallel Intelligence Gathering** - Processes multiple intelligence types concurrently
- **Rate Limiting** - Respectful crawling with configurable delays

### Data Quality
- **Structured Schemas** - Predefined data extraction patterns for consistent results
- **Content Length Filtering** - Focuses on substantial content
- **Quality Scoring** - Prioritizes high-value intelligence sources
- **Metadata Preservation** - Maintains crawling context and extraction details

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Basic Website Intelligence Analysis
```typescript
import { analyzeWebsiteIntelligence } from '@/app/search';

// Comprehensive analysis of a company
const stream = await analyzeWebsiteIntelligence('https://gradelab.io', {
  intelligenceTypes: ['pricing', 'team', 'customers', 'products'],
  includeCompetitorAnalysis: true
});
```

### Targeted Intelligence Gathering
```typescript
// Focus on specific intelligence types
const stream = await analyzeWebsiteIntelligence('https://competitor.com', {
  intelligenceTypes: ['pricing', 'customers'], // Only pricing and customer data
  includeCompetitorAnalysis: false
});
```

### ICP Analysis with Enhanced Crawling
```typescript
import { analyzeICP } from '@/app/search';

// The existing ICP analysis now uses enhanced crawling automatically
const stream = await analyzeICP(dossierText, query, context);
```
