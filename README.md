**PHASE 2: OMNICHANNEL SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE**
- LinkedIn Deep Analysis (metrics, content themes, employee advocacy)

- YouTube Content Analysis (strategy, engagement, speaker analysis)
- Reddit Community Intelligence (presence, sentiment, problem discussions)

**PHASE 3: COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE MATRIX**
- Direct Competitor Deep-Dive (feature matrix, pricing strategy, positioning)
- Indirect Competitor Mapping (alternative solutions, build vs. buy options)
- Competitive Content Analysis (messaging, differentiation, partnerships)

**PHASE 4: CUSTOMER INTELLIGENCE MINING**
- Customer Profile Deep-Dive (ICP analysis, journey mapping, success stories)
- Review & Feedback Analysis (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, industry forums)
- Customer Success Intelligence (implementation, training, expansion patterns)

**PHASE 5: INDUSTRY & MARKET INTELLIGENCE**
- Market Context Research (growth rates, regulatory environment, trends)
- Analyst Relations (Gartner, Forrester mentions, industry recognition)

**PHASE 6: TECHNICAL & SECURITY INTELLIGENCE**
- Security Posture Analysis (compliance, certifications, security features)
- Technical Specifications (API documentation, system requirements, integrations)

**PHASE 7: FINANCIAL & BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE**
- Business Health Indicators (funding, revenue, partnerships, growth)
- Risk Assessment (stability, leadership, market position, technology risks)
